.. Python Telegram Bot documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Mon Aug 10 22:25:07 2015.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="display: none">

Hidden Headline
===============
This is just here to get furo to display the right sidebar.

.. raw:: html

    </div>

.. include:: ../../README.rst

.. The toctrees are hidden such that they don't render on the start page but still include the contents into the documentation.
