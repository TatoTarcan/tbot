from telegram import InputMedia, Animation


class InputMediaAnimation(InputMedia):
    """Represents an animation file (GIF or H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video without sound) to be sent.

    Attributes:
        type (:obj:`str`): ``video``.
        media (:obj:`str`): File to send. Pass a file_id to send a file that exists on the Telegram
            servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL for Telegram to get a file from the Internet.
            Lastly you can pass an existing :class:`telegram.Animation` object to send.
        thumb (:obj:`str`): Optional. Thumbnail of the file sent. The thumbnail should be in JPEG
            format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail‘s width and height should not exceed
            90. Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can’t be
            reused and can be only uploaded as a new file, so you can pass
            “attach://<file_attach_name>” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data
            under <file_attach_name>.
        caption (:obj:`str`): Optional. Caption of the video to be sent, 0-200 characters.
        parse_mode (:obj:`str`): Optional. Send Markdown or HTML, if you want Telegram apps to show
            bold, italic, fixed-width text or inline URLs in the media caption.. See the constants
            in :class:`telegram.ParseMode` for the available modes.
        width (:obj:`int`): Optional. Animation width.
        height (:obj:`int`): Optional. Animation height.
        duration (:obj:`int`): Optional. Animation duration.


    Args:
        media (:obj:`str`): File to send. Pass a file_id to send a file that exists on the Telegram
            servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL for Telegram to get a file from the Internet.
            Lastly you can pass an existing :class:`telegram.Video` object to send.
        thumb (:obj:`str`, optional): Thumbnail of the file sent. The thumbnail should be in JPEG
            format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail‘s width and height should not exceed
            90. Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can’t be
            reused and can be only uploaded as a new file, so you can pass
            “attach://<file_attach_name>” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data
            under <file_attach_name>.
        caption (:obj:`str`, optional): Caption of the video to be sent, 0-200 characters.
        parse_mode (:obj:`str`, optional): Send Markdown or HTML, if you want Telegram apps to show

            in :class:`telegram.ParseMode` for the available modes.
        width (:obj:`int`, optional): Animation width.
        height (:obj:`int`, optional): Animation height.
        duration (:obj:`int`, optional): Animation duration.
        supports_streaming (:obj:`bool`, optional): Pass True, if the uploaded video is suitable
            for streaming.

    Note:
        When using a :class:`telegram.Animation` for the :attr:`media` attribute. It will take the
        width, height and duration from that video, unless otherwise specified with the optional
        arguments.
        At the moment using a new file is not yet supported.
