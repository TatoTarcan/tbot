# Make sure to install those as additional_dependencies in the
# pre-commit hooks for pylint & mypy
# Also update the readme accordingly

# When dependencies release new versions and tests succeed, we should try to expand the allowed
# versions and only increase the lower bound if necessary

# httpx has no stable release yet, so let's be cautious for now
httpx ~= 0.25.1
# https://github.com/encode/httpx/commit/280a89a4d13b65852b065b3e1aaa53d388946a88 removed version
# pinning for httpcore in the httpx library, leading to problems with the new `socket_options`
# parameter in httpx 0.25.1 if an old version of httpcore is installed.
# Hence, we pin this here to avoid problems for PTB users. Can be removed once we bump httpx as
# the issue was addressed in https://github.com/encode/httpx/pull/2937.
httpcore >= 0.17.2
